# Password Generator

When creating a new password, I like designing it for easy typability. For example, not using the same finger twice in a row. Passwords generated by most generators I've used are really secure, but aren't that great to type. This project is intended to alleviate that headache.

## Typability

To create a password that is easily typable by the human hand, its helpful to think of how the fingers map to the letters on a keyboard.
